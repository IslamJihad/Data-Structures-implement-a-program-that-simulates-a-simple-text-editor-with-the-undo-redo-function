# Data-Structures-implement-a-program-that-simulates-a-simple-text-editor-with-the-undo-redo-function
In this project you will implement a program that simulates a simple text editor with the undo/redo functionalities allowed. The program will  accept statements, one at a time with a maximum of 100 characters per  line.  There will be some special commands as follows: 1. undo: this will undo (i.e., remove) that last entered statement; 2. redo: this will redo (i.e., re-add) that last removed statement; 3. print: this command will print the entire stored input text; 4. save: will save the text to a file called (output.txt); 5. quit: will exit the program and save all results to output.txt
